## Introduction

Welcome to our powerful template for React Native projects, specifically designed for large-scale applications. This template focuses on providing an exceptional developer experience and optimizing performance. By incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as Typescript, Expo, Expo Router, and Axios, we've created a streamlined development process that will supercharge your next project.

## Features

- **Typescript**: Utilize the benefits of static typing and enhanced tooling with the Typescript language.
- **Expo**: Leverage the power of Expo, a set of tools and services for developing, building, and deploying universal apps.
- **Expo Router**: Seamlessly navigate between screens with Expo Router, a routing library specifically designed for Expo projects.
- **Axios**: Simplify your HTTP requests with Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for making API calls effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- Yarn or npm package manager
- Expo CLI (globally installed)
- Git (optional, but recommended)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`.
2. Change into the project's directory: `cd your-project`.
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install` or `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `expo start`.

## Project Structure

The template follows a well-organized structure to keep your codebase clean and maintainable. Here's an overview of the project structure:

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ themes/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ App.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ .expo/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **src**: Contains all the source code files.
- **components**: Houses reusable components that can be shared across different screens.
- **screens**: Includes individual screen components for different sections of your application.
- **navigation**: Contains navigation-related code and configuration.
- **services**: Provides services for making API calls and handling data.
- **utils**: Contains utility functions and helpers.
- **themes**: Houses theme-related files and styles.
- **App.tsx**: The entry point of your application.

Feel free to adapt the structure to fit the needs of your project.
